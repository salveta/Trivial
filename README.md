Trivial
=======

Trivial Project in first course Programming Studies spepecialized in Multiplatform development

This is a game where you can answer all the questions that you can in 30 seconds. You can add points if you answer 
correct the question.

The game has the name Trivial, but insn't a trivial. Of course, can be similar. 

The project 'Trivial' was a final project in first course Programming Studies spepecialized in Multiplatform development.
In 'Trivial' i have used all the features that we learned in the course (Arrays, loops, windowbuilder, buttons, database, socket to connect two players simultaneously...)

This project was made with my friend Raúl García in pair programming.

Feel free to play it!!!
